## Introduction
In this mini project, a classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. For this problem, [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) is used. In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled "default.payment.next.month" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. For additional information about the data set, [a associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719) is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/).
